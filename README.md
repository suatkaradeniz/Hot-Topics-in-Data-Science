   Stack Exchange is a popular webpage which hosts sites on a multitude of fields 
   and subjects, including mathematics, physics, philosophy, and ***data science*** !
   The website employs a reputation award system for its questions and answers. 
   Each post — each question/answer — is a post that is subject to upvotes and 
   downvotes. This ensures that good posts are easily identifiable.
